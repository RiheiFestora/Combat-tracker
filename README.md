The Source code
---------------
To launch the source code, you will need Qt 6.9.0 (I haven't tested other versions).
I used visual studio to create this and the vcxproj file is provided alongside the source code.

The Application
---------------
1. Download the latest release .zip
2. Extract the zip file wherever you want on your own computer
3. Launch the Combat_tracker.exe file in the extracted folder
4. Enjoy the combat tracker!
